While the goal is to be a music cataloging, rating, reviewing, and recommendation web app; Echord also has a fully functional music data interaction API, and no external authentication processes.

- All of the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, and all interactions are done through the API.
- Authentication is handled through an encrypted JWT token.
- All critical data is encrypted, and all sensitive data is stored in a secure manner.

###### A Next.js application with a PostgreSQL database, and a fully functional API for music data interaction.

- [API](#api)
- [Authentication](#authentication)
  - [User data](#what-data-do-we-store-about-the-user)

---

## API

- We are reliant and integrated with the [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/api) for all music data.
- Upon interactions with music data from the (authorized) client, the data sourced from the Deezer API is cached in our database.
  - Includes relevant data such as album, track, and artist information.
  - Also references the interaction itself, and the user who interacted with the data.
- Only upon **interaction** with the data (music data) is when it is stored in the database along with the interaction/user information.

---

## Authentication

- Authentication is done through an encrypted JWT token, which is stored in a cookie.
- The JWT token is created upon authentication, and is used to authenticate the user for all interactions with the API.

###### What data do we store about the user?

There are many aspects of the application that are not yet implemented, and are planned for future releases.

- The application is in its early stages, and is constantly being updated and improved.
- [Roadmap](./assets/markdown/ROADMAP.md) for more information on the planned features and updates.
- [Interactions](./assets/markdown/INTERACTIONS.md) for more information on the interactions and data storage.
