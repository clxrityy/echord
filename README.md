##### Refactor structure and stacking of components (07-04-2025)

- [x] Move feed display only to the home page
- [x] Refactor a new layout component that uses client capabilities to adjust the layout based on the screen size
  - [x] ~~Kind of done, doesn't work on mobile yet~~
- [x] Refactor the feed component to use a grid layout for the home page

#### fixes

- [x] Fix feed display (server) within `<Window />` (client) **Hydration Error**
  - [x] ~~**Fix**: Just wrapped the `<Hero />` component within the `<Window />` component. This way the window will still be rendered on the client side, but the feed will be rendered on the server side~~
    - [x] **NOTE:** This was not the actual issue, it was with rendering the database functions within a client component. Fixed by moving the database functions to the server side and passing the data to the client component.
